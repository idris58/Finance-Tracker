Design a standalone Personal Finance Tracking app for a single user with a focus on 'Safe-to-Spend' logic.
Architecture & Data Model:
	Use Dexie.js (IndexedDB) for local-first storage.
	Data Model: Create tables for 1. Transactions (amount, category, date, payment_method, note) 2. Budgets (category_name, monthly_limit) 3. Accounts (name, type: Cash/Bank/Mobile, balance) 4. Settings (monthly_income, savings_goal, fixed_bills_total)
	Home Screen: Features a high-visibility dashboard with 'Total Balance' and a dynamic 'Safe-to-Spend' daily indicator. Include a floating '+' button.
	Input Flow: A streamlined entry form for expenses. When an expense is added, subtract it from the 'Total Balance' and update the category progress bar.
	Visuals: Use Progress Bars for category budgets. Integrate a Pie Chart for monthly spending breakdown.
	Mess Integration: Include a specific category for 'Mess Deposits' that links to the user's external meal management costs.
	Design Style: Modern, minimalist UI with a Dark Theme (Deep Navy backgrounds with Gold or Neon Green accents). Use rounded corners and high-contrast text for readability. The UI must be mobile-responsive and feel like a modern banking app.
	Data Safety/Backup: Please include a JSON Export/Import utility in the settings menu to prevent data loss. Add a 'Export Data' button that saves a .json file to my phone, and an 'Import Data' button so I can restore my records if I switch phones or clear my cache.
Technical Requirement: Ensure the app is responsive (works on mobile and desktop) and uses a local-first storage approach to keep it free. saves data directly to the phone/browser's internal memory. For data persistence, use Dexie.js (IndexedDB) so that the app remains 'Full-stack' functional on Replit's free tier.
Use "PWA" (Progressive Web App): Make the app a PWA. This allows you to "Add to Home Screen" on your phone so it looks like a real app.
The App Flow (The Navigation)
The Dashboard (The "Command Center")
This is the first screen you see. It should be clean and not overwhelming.
	Current "Total Cash" (Sum of Bank + Cash in hand).
	"Safe-to-Spend" daily limit. (Example: "You can spend 500 more today to stay on budget").
	Quick Action Button: A large floating "+" button at the bottom center to add an expense instantly.
	Recent Activity: A list of the last 3-4 transactions.
Add Transaction 
This screen must be fast so you don't forget to log small costs (like tea or rickshaw fare).
	Date
	Input Field: Number pad for the amount.
	Category Grid: Visual icons (Food, Mess/meal Deposit, Transport, Mobile Recharge, Entertainment).
	Toggle: "Cash" or "Bank/Card” Or “Bkash/Nagad".
	Note/Description (e.g., "Lunch with Rudro").
Transactions: A list view of all spending with the ability to filter by month.
Budget & Categories (The "Strategy View")
This is where you plan your month.
	Category Progress Bars: Each category shows a bar.
	Green: Under 50% spent.
	Yellow: 80% spent (Warning).
	Red: Over budget.
	Fixed Bills Section: A place to list your Rent, Mess/meal deposit, utilities, and Internet bills so they are subtracted from your "Safe-to-Spend" balance immediately.
Analytics (The "Reflection View")
	Pie Chart: A simple chart showing: "Where is my money going?"
	Monthly Comparison: A bar chart comparing this month's spending vs. last month.
The "Smart" Logic (The Math)
To make it user-friendly, the app should calculate your "Safe-to-Spend" (STS) limit automatically.
The Formula: 
"Daily STS"  = [(Monthly Income - Fixed Bills - Savings Goal) - Current Month's Expenses] / Days Remaining in Month
This formula computes the maximum amount that can be safely spent per day after accounting for mandatory expenses and planned savings, evenly distributed across the remaining days of the month.
	Fixed Bills: Mess meal costs, Rent, utilities, etc.
	Savings Goal: The amount you want to keep untouched.
	Result: This tells you exactly how much you can spend on "Wants" (snacks, hangouts) today without failing your monthly goal.
